        Beautiful, Simple, and Effective
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Canopy is a desktop vertical farm. It integrates sun-mimicking LEDs, a moving "canopy" which allows adjusting of light intensity, deep water culture hydroponics, and a strong, stackable structure into the most beautiful consumer vertical farm on the market. Earlier this year, we were <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thecanopy/the-canopy-smart-vertical-farm">successfully funded on Kickstarter</a>. We are currently working to fulfill orders with our newly-bought Prusa 3D printer.

        Our Design
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Canopy's design is inspired by the form of a tree. The structure flows from bottom to top in a modern architecture suitable for heightening any home. The body is designed for stability, able to withstand significant weight and easily hold other units above.

        Vertical Farming
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Canopy can be easily stacked to become a vertical farm. Units sit stably on top of each other and can be individually adjusted to grow many different plants at the same time. The Canopy is <b>the only</b> system on the market that stacks and has adjustable lights at the same time.
